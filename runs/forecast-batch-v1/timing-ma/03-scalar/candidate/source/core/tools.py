"""
Deterministic geo helpers used for competition scoring.

This is a deliberate pure-Python copy of BlueSky's ``kwikqdrdist``. BlueSky
silently swaps in compiled C implementations of its geo functions when they are
available, and those results do not match the pure-Python ones bit-for-bit. All
competition *metric* computations (intrusions, distances-to-goal, etc.) route
through this copy so that scores are reproducible across machines regardless of
whether a given install has the compiled extensions. Observation code, which is
competitor-owned and not scored, may use ``bs.tools.geo`` directly.
